You are a teacher in a school. It is the final result declaration week. You have to calculate the cumulative 
marks of all the subjects and deliver ranking based on the percentage calculated. You have to create an 
OOP solution to deliver the corresponding result. 
You are supposed to develop a small application, which accepts Roll No and displays the following details 
as output:
Individual subject marks 
Total marks
Percentage
Rank
The criteria for calculating Rank is as follows :
TOTAL MARKS OF ALL SUBJECTS (TM) = M1+M2+M3+M4+M5
PERCENTAGE= (TM/5)*100
RANK = ABOVE 95 % ---- A+
 80-94 % ---------A
 70-79 % ---------B+
 60-69 % ---------B
 50-59 % ---------C
 40-49 % ---------D
